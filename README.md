**Product concept** : an app that uses google cloud software (or others, TBD) to map out your bus route and wake you up on arrival to your destination.

    - As mentionned, would use google cloud api for maps and app dev tools
        - Browser version would use other methods to create the app

    - Multi purpose locational service app with built in alarm functionality
        - Gives you the ability to set your bus route on the app and will notify you of when you approach 
        - Can be used as a general GPS to tell you where you need to drive
        - Can wake you up if you dozed off and you're nearing your stop
            - Smart watch compatibility needed
            - Would send a small electrical current to wake you up

    - If allowed by the user, enables data collection as to run a profit off the app
        - Selling this data would provide us a way to sustainably update the app without extorting to ads
        - Alternative : Ads 
            - in-app purchase to remove ads ig

    - Can be used as a speedometor 
        - i.e. walking, running, biking, etc...
            - Lake data and support is unclear
