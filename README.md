Product concept : an app that uses google cloud software (or others, TBD) to map out your bus route and wake you up on arrival to your destination.
    - As mentionned, would use google cloud api for maps and app dev tools
        - Browser version would use other methods to create the app
    - Created in the hopes of stopping people from missing their stops
        - Uses GPS data to tell you when it's your stop (public transport)
        - Can be used as a general GPS to tell you where you need to drive
        - Can wake you up if you dozed off and you're nearing your stop
            - Smart watch compatibility needed
    - If allowed by the user, enables data collection as to run a profit off the app
        - Selling this data would provide us a way to sustainably update the app without extorting to ads
        - Alternative : Ads 
            - Ads aren't cool... - in-app purchase to remove ads ig
    - Can be used as a speedometor 
        - i.e. walking, running, biking, etc...
            - Lake data and support is unclear
